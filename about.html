          <h2>Who I Am</h2>
          <p>
            I‚Äôm Adeyemi Emmanuel, a Frontend Developer and Computer Science
            student at the University of Ilorin. I enjoy creating clean,
            responsive, and accessible web interfaces that blend good design
            with solid code. My journey into web development started from
            curiosity ‚Äî wanting to understand how the websites I used daily were
            built.

          <h2>Goals in This Program</h2>
          <p>
            My main goal in this program is to deepen my frontend development
            skills and learn to work efficiently in real-world, collaborative
            environments. I want to sharpen my problem-solving skills, build
            more structured projects, and understand how to turn design ideas
            into functional, high-quality user experiences.

          <h2>Areas of Low Confidence</h2>
          <p>
            I‚Äôm still building confidence in advanced JavaScript concepts and
            backend integration. Sometimes I overthink design choices or spend
            too much time trying to make things ‚Äúperfect.‚Äù But I‚Äôm learning to
            focus more on progress and consistency.

          <h2>Note to Future Self</h2>
          <p>
            Dear future Emmanuel, keep building. Remember that every error, bug,
            and failed attempt was part of your growth. Stay humble, keep
            learning, and don‚Äôt forget the passion that made you start. Be
            consistent ‚Äî and always celebrate your small wins.

          <h2>Extra Thoughts</h2>
          <p>
            Beyond code, I‚Äôm passionate about teaching, mentoring, and
            contributing to the tech community. I believe the best developers
            aren‚Äôt just problem solvers ‚Äî they‚Äôre learners who never stop
            sharing.
